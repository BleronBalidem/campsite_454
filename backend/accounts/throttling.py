"""
Rate limits on login and register (TM05-88): DRF's ScopedRateThrottle, per client IP, with
the rates in settings.REST_FRAMEWORK["DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES"] (docs/auth.md).

Scoped rather than a default throttle so only these two endpoints are limited: the map,
the panel and everything a signed-in user does are untouched. DRF has no decorator for a
function view's scope, so `throttle_scope()` sets it on the view class @api_view built.

Over the limit is a 429 with a Retry-After header, and this module's exception handler
gives it the API's usual {"error": ...} body with a sentence a person can act on.
